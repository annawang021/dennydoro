Dennydoro is a custom pomodoro timer created to help keep you on focused. 

Inspired by my best friend's late cat Denny, this timer was tailored to the core to this special orange cat -- the bowtie play button is reminiscent of his iconic collar, and the images, sounds, and colors are all Denny's.

Work hard and make Denny proud!

### Features
- Start/Pause: To start or pause the timer, click the bowtie or hit your space key.
- Switch modes: To switch to focus or break, click the arrow or hit your right arrow key.
- Settings: To access settings, click the toggle icon or hit your left arrow key. To exit, click the X, click outside of the settings box, or hit your escape key. The settings you input (display theme, time, sound, notification preferences) will be saved in your browser each time as part of your local storage. The settings are defaulted to 1 hour focus and 15 minutes break, which you can revert back to by clicking the reset button.
- Sound: Hover over Denny to hear him purr. There are also purring sounds when you start the timer. Denny will meow when you switch focus modes or the timer ends.
- Total focus time: Denny's laying on the total focus time display, which automatically pauses when you switch to break mode. To reset it, you can click it or simply refresh the page.
